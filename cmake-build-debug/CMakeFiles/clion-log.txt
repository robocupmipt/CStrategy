CMake Error at /home/nikita/.local/share/cmake/qibuild/internal/uselib.cmake:80 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindALCOMMON.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "ALCOMMON",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ALCOMMON" with any
  of the following names:

    ALCOMMONConfig.cmake
    alcommon-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ALCOMMON" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ALCOMMON_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "ALCOMMON" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
